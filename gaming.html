<p> This is the hobby I've dont the longest, ever since I was a child. Of course the games i play now are more mature but the first time my mother bought me a game which was a Gameboy sp, I've been a gamer. I've moved on to the playstation for some years now.<img src="images/ps4.jpg" width="40%"" height="auto" class="center-responsive"> Sometimes I watch high level gaming on Twitch, a streaming site for games. People are making millions of dollars playing games. I would like to make a good amout of money playing games some day. But for now i ll just concentrate on staying on top of the leaderboards.</p>
