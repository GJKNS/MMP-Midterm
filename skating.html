<p>I've been skating for about 5 years now. Out of all my favorite hobbies this one cnage my life the most. Skating taught me so many things, introduced me to so many people and taught me new things.</p>
<img src="images/dreads.jpg" width="40%"" height="auto"class="center-responsive"><p> It even changed my appearance. 
This is also the hobby that hurt me the most. Skating in N.Y is hard. I've been hit so many times by cars, i have a couple scars on my body, but it comes with the hobby. Skating is a way of life for some people.</p>
