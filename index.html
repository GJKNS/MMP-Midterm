<h2>What's the point of this website?</h2>

<p> My name is Gerald Stephens, and the point of this website is to give you, the audience, an idea of what I like to do in my spare time. All of my favorite hobbies tend to be very competitive. They say your hobbies reflect the kind of person you are and my hobbied reflect me 100%. My Favorite hobbies are basketball, skating and gaming. Like I implied before, I am VERY competitive. If im playing a team game of basketball I want to be the most impactful player on the court. I want to be on the top of the leaderboards when I game. I want to be in front of everyone else when I'm skating. Not only do I personally participate in those activities but I've recently started watching them on different websites and televised.</p>
	<p>Although those are my main hobbies that I love to do, I dabble in editing softwares such as photoshop and premiere. I like creating memems or just manipulate a photo. <img src="images/tj.jpg"  width="40%"" height="auto" class="center-responsive">That photo is a personal project that im working on where I photoshot different things into the painting each month. This month is coco pebbles. <img src="images/coco.jpg"  width="50%"" height="auto" class="center-responsive">
