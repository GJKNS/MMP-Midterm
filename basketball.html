<p> When I play any sport, especially basketball I want to be the best player. I want to be the reason my team win. If I'm being honest, I Rather lose and be the best player than to win and not have contributed anything to the victory. I really don't like losing. </p>

<p>I usually go to the recreation center to play ball or work out at least 3 times a week. </p>

<p> I started watching basketball about 2 years ago because it happened to be on and the Warriors were playing a high seed team at the time. The game was actually interesting and it hooked me. At the time the warriors were trying to break the NBA record for most wins in a season, so there was a lot of energy in the arina and where i was watching it. Prior to this Nba games did not interest me. I would rather play it. Ever since, I've been a Warrior Fan.
